Welcome to my page! Iâ€™m Tisya, a Bachelorâ€™s student at Imperial College London with a keen interest in cancer biology, genetics, and epigenetics. My passion lies in understanding how genetic and epigenetic changes drive disorders like cancer, and I enjoy using bioinformatics to explore complex biological data and uncover patterns that could inform new therapeutic approaches.<br>

At Imperial, Iâ€™m developing a foundation in both lab-based and computational methods, exploring how we can combine molecular biology with data science to tackle pressing challenges. Iâ€™m especially drawn to the potential of personalized medicine and using big data to better understand disease mechanisms.<br>

Outside of academics, Iâ€™m an advocate for sustainability and enjoy spending time in nature, often taking long walks to recharge. I'm always open to connecting with others who share similar interests in science and sustainabilityâ€”feel free to reach out!<br>
