Welcome to my page! I’m Tisya, a Biochemistry student with a keen interest in cancer biology, genetics, and epigenetics. My interest lies in understanding how genetic and epigenetic changes drive disorders like cancer, and I enjoy using bioinformatics to explore complex biological data and uncover patterns that could inform new therapeutic approaches.<br>

At Imperial, I developed a strong foundation in both laboratory and computational methods, learning how molecular biology and data science can be combined to study gene regulation and genome dynamics. I’m also increasingly interested in how these principles apply beyond human systems — particularly in plants, which offer powerful models for studying genome organisation, evolution, and adaptation.<br>

Outside of academics, I’m an advocate for sustainability and enjoy spending time in nature, often taking long walks to recharge. I'm always open to connecting with others who share similar interests in science and sustainability—feel free to reach out!<br>
